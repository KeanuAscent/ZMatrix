<p>This is the distribution page for ZMatrix.&nbsp; ZMatrix is an animated
desktop background which displays streaming characters in a style similar to
what was used in the movie 'The Matrix'.&nbsp; The program was based off of
source code for a screen saver found at <a href="http://www.elouai.com">www.elouai.com</a>,
and is entirely free.&nbsp; If you have problems with
ZMatrix please review the help documentation that comes with the program, or visit
the the help documentation online using the 'Help' link on the list to the left of this page.

<blockquote>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">May 25, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.5.2 released. &nbsp;Another quick bug-fix release.&nbsp;
Mainly done to address the rendering issue showing up in opaque mode.&nbsp; I'm also
taking this release as a chance to tidy things up a bit.&nbsp; Removed the upgrade
installers.&nbsp; They were too much trouble to maintain, and I had gotten lazy and
stopped differentiating them from the full installs anyways.
</p>

<p class="NewsBody">On a somewhat related note, I got to go see The Matrix Reloaded
today.&nbsp; Good film.&nbsp; Got to see a friend's name in the credits, very cool,
Sam, you rock.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">May 21, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.5.1 released. &nbsp;This is a quick follow-up release to 1.5.0
to address column spacing problems that were sometimes occurring with the newer Matrix Code Font bundled
with 1.5.0.&nbsp; This release uses the older, more dependable font.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">May 19, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.5.0 released. &nbsp;First new release in a long time.&nbsp;
Done in time (more or less) for the new Matrix film.&nbsp; This release includes some
spiffy new features such as the 'Special String Streams' and the addition of the Winamp Visualization
Plugin.&nbsp; Less flashy/notable additions include the new references to the help documentation
(online and in the program), and the addition of a dialog to shamelessly plug myself to people
in need of a software developer.&nbsp; Many thanks to those who suggested new features and reported
bugs.
</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Also of note in this new release are the updates to the credits/acknowledgments.&nbsp;
The original author of the matrix screensaver that this project was based off of contacted me and let me
know that his new website is <a href="http://www.elouai.com">www.elouai.com</a>.&nbsp;
The producer of the 'Matrix Code Font' bundled with ZMatrix is now known as e-RBi, you can visit his
website at <a href="http://e-rbi.com">e-rbi.com</a>, or email him at <a href="mailto:contact@e-rbi.com">contact@e-rbi.com</a>.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">February 3, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.8 released. &nbsp;Quick bug fix to take care of the
'top or left positioned taskbar' problem which was supposed to be fixed before, but wasn't
completely.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">February 1, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.7 released. &nbsp;The most important change in this
version is the addition of Win9x/Me support.&nbsp; I am recommending Win98 or later
with IE 5.0 or later installed, but if someone has success running on earlier system
specs., post a message in the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=60257" target="_top">Discussion Forums</a>
and let me, and everyone else know.&nbsp; Also, please note that I'm no longer bundling
the MS Gothic font with ZMatrix, but am using a much smaller, Matrix specific font.&nbsp;
Much thanks goes to the developer of this font: Realm Beyond iNSANiTY (RBi), see the readme
for information on the font.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">January 13, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.6 released. &nbsp;More bug fixes and some new features such
as different blending modes, and screen saver specific configuration.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">January 4, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.5 released. &nbsp;A bugfix release.&nbsp; This one should remove the
'Failed to get RGN for SysListView' error message being reported by some people.&nbsp; This error seems
to have been occurring if there were no icons on the desktop.
</p>

<p class="NewsBody">I'd also like to thank all the people who have reported bugs, and helped in the debugging
of the last two versions of ZMatrix.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">January 3, 2003</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.4 released. &nbsp;Mostly a bugfix release.&nbsp; Continued improvement
of the Active Desktop support, and hopefully better XP compatibility.&nbsp; Also, I am now providing
an 'Upgrade' installer for people who already have a version of ZMatrix installed...&nbsp; The idea is
to reduce the download size for people on dial-up.&nbsp; See the change log/history below for a list of
all changes.
</p>
<p class="NewsBody">On a completely unrelated note: when did so many download sites start to suck so much?
&nbsp;CNet/Downloads.com/WhateverTheHellElseTheyWantToCallThemselves won't even let me update my software posting
with them unless I pay $79.&nbsp; Tucows now has a seperate login location for us non-subscribed authors, and
is constantly trying to convince you to shell out for faster update processing.&nbsp; Now, I thought that these
sites were supposed to have a mutually beneficial relationship with software authors... by having our software
posted, we bring them page hits, and they in return get us a larger audience for our software.&nbsp; Anyways,
I'm ranting... but there is a point: I'd like to give full credit to <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com">Major Geeks</a>
for being the best download site to deal with.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">December 25, 2002 -- Merry Christmas</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.3 released. &nbsp;Many bug fixes and new features in this release.
&nbsp;This release should work reasonably well with Active Desktop. &nbsp;For a complete
list of the changes in this version, see the change log at the bottom of this page. &nbsp;
Please let me know of any problems experienced with this version of the program via the
sourceforge web interfaces listed at the top of the page. &nbsp;I've also started taking
<a href="./donate.html">donations</a> of any amount from anyone who enjoys the program,
and feels that it's worth something. &nbsp;Also, to help shrink the download size of the
program, I'm looking into a web-install, so that un-needed elements (namely, the font used
by the program) don't have to be downloaded if they're already on the target machine.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">August 29, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.2 released.&nbsp; Version 1.4.1 was accidentally bundled as a debug build.  Sorry.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">August 28, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.1 released with multiple bug fixes.
</p>
<p>Also, just to notify anyone who cares, I'll be leaving on a trip in mid September,
and I likely won't be back till early to mid December (a guy wears just one
'FBI Relocation Program' T-Shirt, and they say your cover's blown... geeez).&nbsp; I'm just
kidding.&nbsp; I will be away though, so there likely won't be updates for a while,
and questions sent to zmatrix_background@hotmail.com will likely not be answered for a while.
</p>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">August 19, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Version 1.4.0 released with significant changes.&nbsp; Source code is now released under GNU GPL.
</p>


<p class="NewsSubHeading">August 16, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Project hosting moved to SourceForge.

<p class="NewsSubHeading">April 06, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE (preferably dead): One elusive bug.  I've had more than one
report of people receiving an error message stating "Error, couldn't get RGN for SysListView32".&nbsp;
For some people, the message is persistent (every time the program starts or
refreshes), for others, it is transient (happens once in a while).&nbsp; I have
been unable to reproduce this error message on my machine, although enough
people have mentioned it to me to assure me that it exists.&nbsp; What I'd like
is for anyone who:</p>

<ol class="NewsBody">
  <li>Has or is willing to get the source for the program (see the <a href="#Development"> Development</a>
    section below),</li>
  <li>Can compile the main module of the source using MSVC, AND</li>
  <li>Can reproduce the error on their computer</li>
</ol>

<p class="NewsBody">to send me an email (<a href="mailto:zmatrix_background@hotmail.com">zmatrix_background@hotmail.com</a>),
and hopefully take some time to help me track down and get this bug.&nbsp; I've
got a suspicion regarding how it can be solved, but since I can't reproduce it
on my system, I can't really efficiently try it out and see.&nbsp;
</p>



<p class="NewsSubHeading">March 21, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">By request, I have made the source code for the program publicly
available.&nbsp; Use the 'Development' link on the left, or scroll down to the
development section for the download.&nbsp; The code is intended primarily as a
learning tool, but I have tried to ensure that anyone can use it as they need
it.&nbsp; For that reason, it is distributed under a BSD style license.&nbsp;
The specifics of the licensing can be found in the README.txt file within the
zip.&nbsp; In order to fully compile the code, you will need both Visual Studio
(6.0) and Borland C++ Builder (6.0).&nbsp; Hopefully this will not be a problem
for too many people.&nbsp; If there are files which I have neglected to include
in the source distribution, or if you have comments on/fixes for the code, feel
free to email me at <a href="mailto:zmatrix_background@hotmail.com">zmatrix_background@hotmail.com</a>

<p class="NewsSubHeading">Feb. 06, 2002</p>

<p class="NewsBody">Well, I just realized that this little program is being linked to by a few
places (even got USA Today's &quot;Pick of the Day&quot; on Feb. 04,
2002).&nbsp; So I guess it's time to add a download counter and add some more
'user friendly' features to the program.&nbsp; Here's what I'm considering
doing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="NewsBody">-Improving (read: creating) 'Active Desktop' compatibility. [suggested by
  Paul V.]<br>
  -Investigate functionality on a dual monitor setup. [suggested by Samantha]<br>
  -Have the program function as a screensaver as well as a background.
  [suggested by Robyn T.]<br>
  -Port the program to KDE and/or GNOME. [suggested by Paul F.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="NewsBody">If there's anything else you think should this program should do (besides
walk, talk, and work under Win9x), feel free to send the suggestion to <a href="mailto:zmatrix_background@hotmail.com">zmatrix_background@hotmail.com</a>

<p class="Heading"> Screen Save
</p>

<p>Selecting this menu item causes ZMatrix to enter screen saver mode.&nbsp; This is not the
same as running the current Windows screen saver, it does not use password protection, or run a different
screen saver if it is set as the current Windows screen saver.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Set As Screen Saver
</p>

<p>Selecting this menu item causes ZMatrix to be set as the current Windows screen saver.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Always Set As Screen Saver While Running
</p>

<p>If this menu item is checked, then ZMatrix will check to see if it is the current Windows screen saver
whenever it starts, and if it isn't, it will set itself as the current Windows screen saver, and when ZMatrix
exits, it restores the screen saver it replaced previously.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Blend Screen Saver With Background Only
</p>

<p>If this menu item is checked, then when ZMatrix is in screen saver mode with a blend mode of Bitmap, it will
blend with the desktop wallpaper only, otherwise, if in screen saver mode with a blend mode of Bitmap, it will
blend with the current screen contents (visible windows and all).
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Add/Edit Screen Saver Configuration...
</p>

<p>It is possible to have different settings for the screen saver mode of ZMatrix than for the normal, background
mode of ZMatrix.&nbsp; By selecting this menu item, you are shown the configuration dialog and allowed to edit
the settings which ZMatrix will use when in screen saver mode.&nbsp; If no screen saver specific configuration
is ever specified, ZMatrix will use the same settings in screen saver mode as are used in the normal, background
mode.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Delete Screen Saver Configuration
</p>

<p>If a screen saver configuration has been entered previously, you may remove it and return to the default
screen saver behaviour of using the normal, background settings by selecting this menu item.

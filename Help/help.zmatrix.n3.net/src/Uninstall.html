<p class="Introduction">
Uninstalling ZMatrix is as simple as exiting the program, then selecting the 'Uninstall ZMatrix' shortcut
in the ZMatrix installation folder.
</p>

<p>
To begin the Uninstall process, you must exit the ZMatrix program (if it is running).&nbsp; You may exit
the program using the 'Exit' option in the right click context menu shown below:

<p>
After you have exited ZMatrix, you may perform the actual uninstallation by selecting the 'Uninstall ZMatrix'
shortcut from the ZMatrix folder in the 'Programs' section of the Start Menu.&nbsp; Alternatively, you may
uninstall ZMatrix by using the 'Add/Remove Programs' dialog in the Control Panel.
</p>

<p>
Uninstalling ZMatrix will try to remove all files/registry entries created during the install process, as well
as all files/registry entries created during the use of the program.&nbsp; The one exception is the configuration
files.&nbsp; ZMatrix is designed to keep seperate configuration files for each different Windows user who runs
the program.&nbsp; These seperate configuration files are not removed by an uninstall.&nbsp; If you must remove
these files (recommended for expert users only), they are located in the 'Application Data' folder for each
individual user, under a '.ZMatrix' sub-folder.

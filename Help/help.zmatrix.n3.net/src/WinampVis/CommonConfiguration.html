<p class="Introduction">
Most or all of the Winamp visualization modules use a common configuration dialog.&nbsp;
This dialog allows the user to specify the baseline and peak properties of the effect (color offset, color scale, etc..).

<p class="Heading"> Base Color Offset
</p>

<p>This is the offset applied to the color as the effect approaches the baseline of its range.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Base Color Scale
</p>

<p>This is the scale/weighting applied to the color as the effect approaches the baseline of its range.&nbsp;
The units are percent.&nbsp; A scale of 100 means scale by 1.0, i.e.: no change.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Peak Color Offset
</p>

<p>This is the offset applied to the color as the effect approaches the peak of its range.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Peak Color Scale
</p>

<p>This is the scale/weighting applied to the color as the effect approaches the peak of its range.&nbsp;
The units are percent.&nbsp; A scale of 100 means scale by 1.0, i.e.: no change.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Global Color Offset
</p>

<p>This is the offset applied to the value of the effect before color is calculated.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Global Color Scale
</p>

<p>This is the scale/weighting applied to the value of the effect before color is calculated.&nbsp;
The units are percent.&nbsp; A scale of 100 means scale by 1.0, i.e.: no change.

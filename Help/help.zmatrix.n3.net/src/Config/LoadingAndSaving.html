<title>Loading And Saving Configuration Settings</title>
</head>


<body>

<p class="Introduction">
All of the settings that are controllable by the configuration dialog (as well as the 'Priority' setting which is controlled
by the right click menu) can be loaded from/saved to .cfg files.&nbsp; The .cfg file format is a basic INI file format, but may
change in the future.&nbsp; Configuration settings are normally loaded and saved automatically to a file specific to the current
logged in Windows user, this file is typically located at:
</p>

<p class="Introduction">
C:\Documents And Settings\\<CURRENT_USER_NAME\>\Application Data\.ZMatrix\ZMatrix.cfg
</p>

<p class="Introduction">
If this file is deleted, ZMatrix will replace it with the default settings the next time it starts.&nbsp;
Also, ZMatrix automatically saves screensaver specific settings to another file typically located at:
</p>

<p class="Introduction">
C:\Documents And Settings\\<CURRENT_USER_NAME\>\Application Data\.ZMatrix\ZMatrixScreenSaver.cfg
</p>

<p class="Introduction">
But, sometimes it may be necessary to save and load a configuration to another location for later use, such as restoring old/different
settings, sending your settings to other users, etc...&nbsp; This can be done using the 'Load...' and 'Save...' menu items within the
'File' menu of the configuration dialog.

<p class="Heading"> Saving
</p>

<p>After selecting the 'Save...' menu item, you will be prompted to select a '.cfg' file to save the settings to.&nbsp; Simply
select a new or existing file you want to save to, and the settings will be written to that file.&nbsp;
If you want to change the default settings (so that all users have certain settings when they use ZMatrix for the first time),
you may save to the default configuration file typically located at:
</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\ZMatrix\default.cfg
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Loading
</p>

<p>After selecting the 'Load...' menu item, you will be prompted to select a '.cfg' file to load the settings from.&nbsp; Simply
select the file you want to load from, and the settings will be updated to reflect the configuration settings within the file.&nbsp;
If you want to load the default settings, you may load the default configuration file typically located at:
</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\ZMatrix\default.cfg
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Loading Defaults
</p>

<p>To quickly load the default settings, you may use the 'Load Defaults' menu item.&nbsp; It will load the settings from the default
configuration file typically located at:
</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\ZMatrix\default.cfg
</p>

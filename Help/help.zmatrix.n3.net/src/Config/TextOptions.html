<p class="Introduction">
The 'Text' options within the configuration dialog allow you to specify the fonts used by ZMatrix
when rendering matrix streams, as well as choosing what characters or strings
ZMatrix can use when rendering both regular and special string matrix streams. &nbsp;A regular stream
is composed of characters randomly chosen from a defined set, and a special string stream is composed
similarly, but will have an ordered string show up during its rendering.

<p class="Heading"> Font
</p>

<p>This button takes you to a font selection dialog which allows you to choose the font name, size, and style
to be used by ZMatrix when rendering regular characters in matrix streams.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Special String Font
</p>

<p>This button takes you to a font selection dialog which allows you to choose the font name, size, and style
to be used by ZMatrix when rendering special strings in matrix streams.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Character Set
</p>

<p>This button takes you to a character set editing dialog which lets you choose which characters can be used by
ZMatrix when rendering both regular and special string matrix streams.

	Character Set Editing Dialog
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Standard Character Set
</p>

<p>The standard character set is used when rendering regular segments of a matrix stream.&nbsp;
Within the standard character set editing section is a comma seperated list of characters that ZMatrix can currently use
when rendering matrix streams.&nbsp; You can remove, add, or modify items from this list, and it is not necessary
to maintain the comma seperated format of the list.&nbsp; If the list format is changed, when parsing the list,
the program will simply seperate all non-whitespace characters (except for the '\' and ',' characters), and use that
as its character set.
</p>

<p>International (Unicode) characters can be typed in directly, or can be specified using 'C' style escape sequences.&nbsp;
For example, the Unicode character encoded as hex value 5A42 can be typed into the character set editor as '\0x5A42', and the
editor will translate this string into the character 5A42 when parsing the character set.
</p>

<p>The character set editor also provides functionality for saving and loading text files used as character sets.&nbsp; The 'Load...'
and 'Save...' buttons on the dialog will load and save the character set to a simple (8-bit) ANSI encoded file respectively.&nbsp;
If the character set contains characters which cannot be encoded in 8-bit ANSI, they are converted to escape sequences during the save
operation, then, during the load operation, all escape sequences are identified and converted to proper Unicode characters.
</p>

<p>To include a '\' or ',' character in the character set and not have them ignored as formatting, you may use the '\\' and '\,'
escape sequences.
</p>

<p>Note that for the 'Matrix Code Font' which comes bundled with ZMatrix, the full use-able character set is:
</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, a, b, c, d
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Special Strings
</p>

<p>Special strings are a set of strings that will be displayed as an ordered set of characters when rendering
the matrix streams.&nbsp;
Within the special strings editing section is a newline seperated list of strings that ZMatrix can currently use
when rendering matrix streams.&nbsp; You can remove, add, or modify items from this list.
</p>

<p>The special string editing section follows the same rules for international (Unicode) characters and loading/saving
as is outlined in the 'Standard Character Set' section above.
</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE that loading large files into the special strings set can cause a moderately long delay when displaying
the character set editing dialog. &nbsp;This delay only occurs when displaying the edit dialog, and should not slow
down the loading/rendering times of the program.

<p class="Introduction">
Using ZMatrix as a screen saver only (not as an animated background) is done by ensuring that
the auto-start features are disabled, and specifying ZMatrixSS as the current windows screen
saver.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Step 1: Disabling Auto-Start
</p>

<p>Right click on the ZMatrix icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Select the 'Auto-Start Options' sub menu.
&nbsp; Ensure that all auto-start options are un-checked.&nbsp; If any auto-start options are checked,
click on them, and they should become un-checked.&nbsp; If the 'Auto-Start For All Users' option doesn't
become checked/un-checked when you click on it, you likely don't have the administrator or power user
permissions required to change that setting, and should ask a person who has those permissions to make that
change.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Step 2: Setting ZMatrix As The Screen Saver
</p>

<p>Right click on the ZMatrix icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Select the 'Screen Saver Options' sub menu.
&nbsp; Select the 'Set As Screen Saver' option within the sub menu.
</p>

<p class="Heading"> Step 3: Exiting ZMatrix
</p>

<p>Right click on the ZMatrix icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Select the 'Exit' menu item.
</p>


<p>After these steps, ZMatrix should no longer be running in background mode (and will not
automatically run in background mode on startup), but will be launched when Windows goes into
screen save mode.

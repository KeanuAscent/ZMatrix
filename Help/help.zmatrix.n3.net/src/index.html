<p class="Introduction">
ZMatrix is an animated desktop background which displays streaming characters in a style similar to
what was used in the movie 'The Matrix'.&nbsp; Furthermore, the program is capable of functioning
as a Windows screensaver as well as desktop background.&nbsp; The program was based off of
source code for a screen saver found at <a href="http://www.elouai.com" target="_blank">www.elouai.com</a>,
and is entirely free.&nbsp; Below are examples of ZMatrix running
in background mode, and in screen saver mode...
